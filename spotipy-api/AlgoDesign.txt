* Access X types of user listening history (Short_term, recently played) to determine a score
for each artist and genre. Use that score to match similar songs/artist
to make genre based playlist.

        - First data set will be SHORT_TERM listening history

            - This has since changed as i now figured how to access the users entire library data. Short SHORT_TERM
            listening histroy wll still be used to determine the proper sonfs that should be reccomended to the user
        - I will start off by accessing that datapoint and pulling each artist genres
        - Based off that data i will then cycle through the genres and grab the most popular one based
        off a genre score. 
        - Make a playlsit using reccomdations to generate artist data
            - cycle through the recoomdations to make sure that tracks arent already in user playlist
            - Depending on the songs popularity to the user, some known songs may be added to keep a sense
            of familularity in the playlist
        
* For few genres (emo,shoegaze type genres), underground artist (or lesser known) will be added in
by myself to introduce a better scope to the genre and to balance out soley main stream being added.
Ofcourse if the user data contains underground already then thats what will be added in, but idk ill
figure that shit out.

* Rotating playlist pictures that match the "vibe" of each genre. 
for starters ill hardcode in my own pictures, but AI genereated images
wil be implemented.
